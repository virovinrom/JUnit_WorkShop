Write tests and implementation code
for TaxCalculator using JUnit framework.

TaxCalculator

Simple rules (1-2):
1) Income up to 20000 is taxed at 25%
2) Income of more than 20000 is taxed at 40%

"Hard" rule:
3) Implement possibility to calculate taxes for different years
   with different % rates for each year (use mock for this)

Write tests first!
Tests should drive implementation!
Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach!
After all refactor your production code and tests!
